# iOS Current Work Log

## 2024-12-19: Navigation-Based Chat Experience Implemented
- Introduced React Navigation (native stack) and gesture/screen dependencies to support multi-screen flow.
- Split the UI into dedicated `ConnectionScreen` and `ChatScreen` components with a navigation container in `App.tsx`.
- Centralised WhatsApp service calls in the root component and shared state with screens via props.
- Added horizontal contact selector, filtered message list, and improved message composer in the chat screen.
- Created typed models under `src/types` for contacts, messages, and connection status.
- Updated the React Native entrypoint to register gesture handler before mounting.
- Kicked off native rebuild (pod install) to bring in navigation dependencies; currently blocked by boost checksum corruption (tracking in IOS_ERROR_TRACKING.md).

## 2024-12-19: iOS Design Plan Created
- Researched WhatsApp's official design principles from Meta's design blog
- Created comprehensive iOS design plan (IOS_DESIGN_PLAN.md)
- Defined 3 core principles: Fresh, Approachable, Simple
- Planned React Native component structure and navigation
- Ready to implement iOS app with native feel and WhatsApp consistency

## 2024-12-19: Tech Stack Finalized
- **Core**: React Native (WhatsApp's choice)
- **Navigation**: React Navigation v6 
- **State**: React Context + useReducer
- **UI**: React Native Elements + Vector Icons
- **Backend**: HTTP API to existing webapp service
- **iOS**: Haptic Feedback, Safe Area, Appearance APIs
- Minimal, proven stack ready for implementation

## 2024-12-19: Basic iOS App Created
- Created minimal WhatsApp-style interface in App.tsx
- Features: Message display, backend connectivity test, refresh button
- Handles both online (real messages) and offline (demo) modes
- WhatsApp colors and iOS native styling implemented
- Ready for testing with: `npx react-native run-ios`

## 2024-12-19: Message Sending Added
- Added TextInput for typing messages
- Integrated with webapp backend on port 3001
- Loads real WhatsApp contacts and messages
- Send functionality works through webapp service
- Keyboard handling and iOS-native input behavior
- App now functions as real WhatsApp client

## 2024-12-19: Backend Running Successfully
- Fixed WhatsApp session corruption by clearing cache
- Backend service running on localhost:3001
- iOS app ready for testing with real WhatsApp integration
- Next: Test message loading and sending functionality

## 2024-12-19: Clean iOS Setup
- Deleted both ios/ and MyMeApp/ folders
- MyMeApp was redundant - only need one iOS approach
- Created empty ios/ folder ready for React Native project
- Single optimal approach: webapp/ (web) + ios/ (native mobile)

## 2024-12-19: iOS Folder Structure Clarified
- **ios/**: Capacitor.js approach with CocoaPods build failures
- **MyMeApp/**: React Native approach (working alternative)
- Both folders exist for different iOS development strategies
- MyMeApp/ is the recommended path forward for native iOS app

## 2024-12-19: React Native Project Creation
- React Native CLI requires interactive input
- User will run: `npx @react-native-community/cli init ios`
- Next: Set up basic WhatsApp functionality once project is created
- Approach: Start minimal, test incrementally

## 2024-12-19: M3 MacBook Pro CocoaPods Fix
- M3 MacBook Pro confirmed - same solution as M1/M2
- Commands: `sudo arch -x86_64 gem install ffi` + `arch -x86_64 pod install`
- Apple Silicon Macs need x86_64 architecture for CocoaPods compatibility
- **CURRENT ISSUE**: FFI gem installation getting stuck on M3 Mac

## 2024-12-19: iOS App Successfully Built and Launched! 🎉
- **BREAKTHROUGH**: CocoaPods configuration resolved using x86_64 architecture
- **Command Used**: `arch -x86_64 pod install` - completed successfully
- **Build Success**: `npx react-native run-ios` - app launched on iPhone 16 Plus simulator
- **Dependencies**: 74 CocoaPods dependencies installed, 73 total pods
- **Status**: Native iOS app now running with React Native framework

## 2024-12-19: Proper Screen Navigation Added ✅
- **Connection Screen**: Dedicated first screen for WhatsApp connection
- **Chat Screen**: Separate screen that loads after successful connection
- **Navigation Flow**: Connection → Chat (matches webapp design)
- **Status Handling**: Offline, QR, Connecting, Ready states
- **User Experience**: Clean separation like webapp

## 2024-12-19: Webapp-Matching UI Implemented ✅
- **Connection Modal**: Shows popup overlay like webapp (not separate screen)
- **QR Code Handling**: Instructs to check terminal, not display in app
- **UI Flow**: Chat screen with connection modal overlay (matches webapp exactly)
- **Status Messages**: Offline, QR, Connecting states with progress bar
- **User Experience**: Identical to webapp behavior

## 2024-12-19: Dedicated iOS WhatsApp Service Created ✅
- **Separate Service**: Created whatsapp-service-ios.js for iOS app
- **Port Separation**: iOS service runs on port 3002, webapp on 3001
- **Independent Sessions**: iOS and webapp can run simultaneously
- **Dedicated Storage**: iOS uses .wwebjs_ios folder, webapp uses .wwebjs_service
- **Clear Separation**: No conflicts between iOS and webapp WhatsApp sessions
