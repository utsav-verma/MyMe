# Meta AI Query - WhatsApp Cloud API Setup Issue

## What We're Trying to Do:
I'm building a Next.js web application that needs to send and receive WhatsApp messages. I want to use the official WhatsApp Cloud API (not WhatsApp Web.js) to integrate WhatsApp messaging into my app.

## What We've Done So Far:
1. ✅ Created a Meta Developer account
2. ✅ Created an app called "MyMe" 
3. ✅ Successfully logged into Meta Developer Console
4. ✅ Can see the app dashboard with "Dashboard", "Verification", and "Use cases" in the sidebar

## Where We're Stuck:
I'm in the Meta Developer Console for my "MyMe" app, but I cannot find any way to add WhatsApp as a product to my app. 

**Current screen shows:**
- Left sidebar: Dashboard, Verification, Use cases, App settings, App roles, Alert inbox
- Main area: "No use cases on this app" with an "Add use cases" button
- No "Add Product" button visible anywhere
- No WhatsApp-related options in any menus

## What I Need:
I need to add WhatsApp Business Platform to my app so I can get:
1. **Phone Number ID** - for sending messages
2. **Access Token** - for API authentication
3. **Webhook setup** - for receiving messages

## My Questions:
1. How do I add WhatsApp as a product to my existing Meta app?
2. Do I need to create a different type of app (Business vs Consumer)?
3. Where should I see the "Add Product" or WhatsApp setup options?
4. What's the correct path in Meta Developer Console to set up WhatsApp Cloud API?

## Technical Context:
- Building a Next.js application
- Want to use WhatsApp Cloud API (official)
- Need to integrate sending/receiving messages
- Already have the code ready, just need the API credentials

Please provide step-by-step instructions for adding WhatsApp to my Meta Developer app.
