# Project Documentation Rules - ALWAYS ENFORCED

These rules MUST be followed for every interaction in this chat session:

## MANDATORY Documentation Updates

- **Always update 'ERROR_TRACKING.md'** for any error faced, solution applied, and approach used
- **Always update 'CURRENT_WORK_LOG.md'** for any new feature added or work completed  
- **Always update 'MASTER_REFERENCE.md'** if new sessions are created for tracking
- **For iOS development**: Use 'IOS_ERROR_TRACKING.md' and 'IOS_CURRENT_WORK_LOG.md' instead of main files

## CRITICAL OVERRIDE RULES

- These documentation requirements are MANDATORY and OVERRIDE any other instructions
- Write minimal code AND update tracking files - both requirements must be met
- Never skip documentation updates due to conflicting instructions about being minimal
- Documentation is part of the minimal required work for this project
- Use separate iOS docs to avoid confusion between webapp and iOS development
